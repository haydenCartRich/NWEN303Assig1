/**
 * I learned that ForkJoinPools are designed for divide and conquer recursive problems like our Merge sort algorithm.
 * Our merge sort algorithm is symmetrical as it divides the problem in two, however during runtime the threads
 * can take more or less time for one branch than the other side. The ForkJoinPool helps the slower branch to catch
 * up by releasing resources from the completed threads and giving them to threads that need them. The ForkJoinPool
 * also seems safer as it doesn't require us to use futures, so there is no need to try Future.get() and do something
 * when catching InterruptedExceptions or ExecutionExceptions.
